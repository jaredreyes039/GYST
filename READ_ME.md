## Data Collected
---
- To try and protect users as much as possible, I want to be transparent in the data collected. For security's sake, GitYourSh*tTogether collects the **minimal necessary data** to function:
    - GH User Data:
        - Name
        - Bio
        - User Avatar
    - GH Repo Data:
        - Total Public Repos
        - Total Private Repos
        - Total Watchers
        - Open Issues
        - Repo Owners
        - Update Dates
    - GH Issue Data:
        - Issue Title
        - Assignees
        - Comments
        - Issue Update Dates
        - Labels
        - Milestones
    - GH Other Data:
        - Total Gists (Priv)
        - Social Status (Following/Followers)
        - Disk Usage

## Data Deletion
---
- Data is washed periodically to improve security and reduce any risks to users
    - Currently, this is a manual process on a weekly basis
    - In the near future, this process will be automated to meet biweekly data deletion goals
        - Likely to be done in the MongoCLI outside of GitYourSh*TTogether
- The option to remove data is only temporarily unavailable; however, if it is of urgency or concern, do not hesitate to reach out to me, and your data will be removed ASAP
    - **Email provided Below**
    - **NOTE:** Data is collected on first login, and subsequently updated until a weekly data wash occurs.
